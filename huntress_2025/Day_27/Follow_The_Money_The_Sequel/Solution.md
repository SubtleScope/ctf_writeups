# Solution

- Pretty easy challenge if you solved the other one. We know that the username is: N0TrustX. Looking around at the Github, there wasn’t much, but the ol’ Twitter (X), is usually a go to: [X/Twitter](https://x.com/N0TrustX)

- On that page, you see some hints and some photos of various locations. Using reverse image search or searching through the photos, you can find some locations. The images below are the process which led to the flags. This cuts out the other location searches for the most direct path.

- This mentions the perfect location and that no one will come looking for the hacker.

- If we “enhance” (lol), we can see the name of a park. If we search that, we get this area:

- Then, we find this post about rating the local coffee joint and a hint about the name: java, grind, etc.

- If you search the area for coffee places and then look for a post around a week ago (write up written 10/27/2025), we see a post from a week ago:
